# Accessible Accordion Component

This project enhances an accordion component by integrating ARIA roles and keyboard interactions to ensure accessibility for all users.

---

## Features

- **ARIA Integration**:  
  Added `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, and `role` attributes to improve compatibility with screen readers.  
- **Keyboard Navigation**:  
  Implemented support for `Tab`, `Enter`, `Space`, `Arrow Up`, and `Arrow Down` keys for seamless keyboard-only navigation.

## How to Test

1. Open the published page URL in your browser.  
2. Use a screen reader (e.g., VoiceOver, NVDA) to verify semantic structure and announcements.  
3. Test keyboard navigation:  
   - Use `Tab` to focus on accordion headers.  
   - Press `Enter` or `Space` to expand or collapse sections.  
   - Use `Arrow Up` and `Arrow Down` to move between headers.
